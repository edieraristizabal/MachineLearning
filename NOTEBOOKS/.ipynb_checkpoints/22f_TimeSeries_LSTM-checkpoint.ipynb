The algorithms main usage falls into NLPs or Time Series, and the main idea behind it relates to processing the information they receive from the previous neuron and applying the activation function from scratch (as the CNN/RNN do), they actually divide the neuron into three main parts from which to set up the input from the next layer of neurons: Learn, Unlearn and Retain gate.
